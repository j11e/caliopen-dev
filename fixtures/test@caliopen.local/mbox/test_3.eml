I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food=
? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I gue=
ss because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

We're rescuing ya. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? A s=
exy mistake. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets=
? Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they
don't pay you or let you go. Oh yeah, good luck with that. This is the wors=
t kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Kids don't turn rotten just
from watching TV.
