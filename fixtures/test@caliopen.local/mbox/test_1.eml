<p>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER H=
IM! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all
the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>
<p>You don't know how to do any of those. Leela, Bender, we're going grave
robbing. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us
trust you? Leela's gonna kill me. File not found.</p>
<h2>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</h2>
<p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. G=
oodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of
 cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though
 they may be…</p>
<ol>

    <li>Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitio=
		us and misunderstood!</li><li>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Y=
		our 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</li><li>Isn't it true th=
		at you have been paid for your testimony?</li>

</ol>

<h3>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything
you ever believed in.</h3>
<p>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. I'm a thing. I was all of
history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!
Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really ho=
ped.</p>

    <li>Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</li><li>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't
		you just get me the death penalty?</li><li>My fellow Earthicans, as I hav=
		e explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular
		''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet ag=
		ainst pollution. Also dark wizards.</li>

<p>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Hi, I'm a naughty
nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I'll get my kit
! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
<p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Why not indeed! Now that the, uh, gar=
bage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhib=
itions? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I'll get my kit!</p>
<p>A true inspiration for the children. Can we have Bender Burgers again? U=
gh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while
we're at it? They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
<p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out
 to have her taken away! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do
it yourself. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wa=
nna be right.</p>
<p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, a=
nd I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Perhaps, but perhaps y=
our civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!
</p>
<p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. You lived before you met me?! I m=
eant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I
could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
<p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. T=
oo much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. No! The cat
shelter's on to me. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
<p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
Negative, bossy meat creature! Meh. Our love isn't any different from yours,
except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
<p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedio=
us. Daylight and everything. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebr=
ity who isn't bound and gagged. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too m=
uch to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
<p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! A true inspiration for the children. Man, I'm
sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. You mean
while I'm sleeping in it? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire.
When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
</p>
<p>They're like sex, except I'm having them! Spare me your space age techno=
babble, Attila the Hun! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor,
perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Is the Space Pope repti=
lian!?</p>
