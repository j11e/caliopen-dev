Shut up and take my money! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the he=
ad. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Spare me your space age techno=
babble, Attila the Hun! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor,
perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Ummmâ€¦to eBay? I'm
a thing. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Shut up a=
nd take my money!

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust yo=
u? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You
can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel
angry!
