I considered that, but I thought it might be more controversial.  The
compilation commands may, in general, be somewhat destructive, and
rerunning them while hitting `r'/`l' may not be what you want at all.

The grep commands, on the other hand, are generally not destructive.  (I
mean, they can be if you say `M-x grep RET rm *', I guess, but that
would be a very strange thing to do.)

They are used in all the other special modes that offer traversing a
history of generated buffers: Info, *Help*, eww...

I don't think so.  Having a 100-long history is basically nothing these
days.  Creating a defcustom for something as trivial as this is a
disservice to our users: Offering pointless things to tweak (and this is
really pointless) is something that Emacs does too much already.
