Can we continue discussing the design from the point we stopped,
please?

One comment that I have about the feature as it was committed is that
if we want to have an easy way of rerunning past commands, then it
should be defined in compilation-mode, so that all its derivatives
will get it.

I also don't see a lot of mnemonic value in binding these commands to
'l' and 'r', and would suggest additional bindings which would be
easier to remember even for those who don't browse URLs all day long.

I also think that 100-long history for these commands is waaaaay too
much.  It should be a defcustom, and the default value should be maybe
10 or 16.
