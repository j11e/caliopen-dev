Same here (tho I use SPC DEL instead).

For me, the full idiom is "SPC DEL C-x C-s" which I use to force Emacs
to save the file.  I'm not sure exactly where/when I need it (it's too
ingrained in muscle memory), but I think it's mostly when I edit a LaTeX
document while it's being compiled, because running "pdflatex" takes
enough time that I may end up saving a file before the end of the
previous compilation is done, so the file's timstamps don't faithfully
record the "freshness" of the output.

For this, `SPC C-x u' at point-min should be sufficient to cause
cperl-mode (and perl-mode as well) to flush all the existing
highlighting data.
