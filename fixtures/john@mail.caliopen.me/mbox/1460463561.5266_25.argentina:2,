Thanks.

First, I suggest that you start the legal paperwork rolling right now,
because without that, discussing such a non-trivial change would be
rather pointless.  If you agree, I will send you the form off-list.

As for the patch: my first comment is about the changes in
tty_look_up_color and in map_tty_color -- why are these needed?  The
sheer number of the supported colors doesn't necessarily require any
changes in the basic design of TTY color support, so I'm not sure what
was the motivation for these changes.

Also, why do we need the 'true-color' option introduced in
tty-colors.el? why isn't 'auto' enough for supporting this terminal?
