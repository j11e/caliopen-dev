As a MELPA maintainer, I'd be very keen to be able to provide users and
package authors with package downloads stats broken down by emacs
version and/or platform.

I don't personally see any tangible privacy concerns with this proposal;
it would be fine for this specific use case to set a more informative
User-Agent header only for requests initiated by package.el if that's an
issue.
