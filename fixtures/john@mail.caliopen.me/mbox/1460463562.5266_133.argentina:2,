I'm not sure about this (this machinery and its implications were
never sufficiently documented, and what I think I know is the result
of a desperate attempt to document it).  However, please explain why
font-lock-ensure-function calls font-lock-DEFAULT-fontify-buffer.  If
it's supposed to be good for any mode, why does it call the default
fontification?

As a matter of fact, if I replace the font-lock-default-fontify-buffer
call with a call to font-lock-fontify-buffer, the problem described by
the OP goes away.  That is why I said what I said.
