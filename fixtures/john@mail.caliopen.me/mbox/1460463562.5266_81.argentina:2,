May I ask why you do not like this behaviour? What stands against it?

Not many do care, for sure, but to those that do this information is all =
the more important.

Speaking on behalf of Flycheck we'd love to have statistics about OS =
distribution among our
users, so much that I thought about adding opt-in Google Analytics =
tracking to Flycheck for
this purpose.  Currently we have literally no idea what people use and =
how much effort we=20
should put into support for particular systems (Windows specifically), =
and we have no way to
find out.
