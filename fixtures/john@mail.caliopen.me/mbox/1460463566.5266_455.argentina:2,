I feel a bit silly, but I rely on this discrepancy (SPC DEL marks the
buffer as changed) so that saving the buffer is an actual operation
which updates the file timestamp, to trigger a rebuild of its dependencie=
s.

For me, the major nuisance is that Emacs claims that the file has
changed on disk, when it fact it hasn't=97the mtime changed, but the
contents is the same.  At least it's easier to detect this case with the
hashing approach you propose.
