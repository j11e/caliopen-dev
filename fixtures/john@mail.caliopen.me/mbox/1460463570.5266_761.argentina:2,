I know I sound like a broken record, but if the UI of git is not
adequate for you then try other UI. I'll suggest Magit, which makes all
those operations trivial to work with. It requires Emacs to run, which
is a fat dependency, but it is worth the disk space IMHO.

The downside is that you might have much less problems with git on the
future, and hence your view about that tool could change a bit and
complain less about it on the ml. You must ponder what causes more
pleasure to you: disparage git or get the job done.
