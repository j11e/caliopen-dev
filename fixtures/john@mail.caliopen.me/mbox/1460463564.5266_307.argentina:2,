Hm...  interesting...

I know next to nothing about Emacs bookmarking.  How are bookmarks
stored (for special mode buffers)?

I'm trying to envision how this would work from a UX point of view.
Let's say you're trying to do some "-Wall" cleanups in emacs/src, and
you've gotten halfway down the list of things you're able to clean up,
so you set a bookmark there.  Then the next time you compile something
in that directory, then point moves to around that point?

Yes, it's an added wrinkle, but I think it should be possible to
handle.  I made a first stab at it in the recently reverted `r'/`l'
code, and it seemed to be kinda nice, even if the implementation wasn't
very general.

Indeed, staying in the "same place" in *vc-diff* would be very nice.
