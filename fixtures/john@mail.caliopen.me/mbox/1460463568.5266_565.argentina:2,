I have elaborated on all these in my other long reply. I would just conclude
here that because both calculate-indent-function and prog-indentation-context
try to solve same problem, they are bound to have overlapping parts. It's just
that calculate-indent-function is more general, easier to understand for prog
authors and it solves three problems at once - replacement of
indent-line-function, removing extra prog-indentation-context/prog-widen and not
exposing multi-mode complexities.

Note also that the intention of the `hard-widen-limit` is to make it work
seamlessly for all existing code that use widen. While prog-indentation-context
requires to teach every mode out there to use prog-widen instead of widen. This
doesn't sound right at all.
