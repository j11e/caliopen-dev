Just do the merge, and if you get conflicts that you do not want to
resolve, 'git merge --abort'.

Single caveat: Do NOT start a merge when you have uncommited changes.
If you want, do 'git stash' first to recover them later.

See above.

It seems you are confused about some concepts.  The 'fetch' part of
'pull' has already dragged *all* commits into your local repository.
Now the question is about how to merge the branches (say 'master' and
'origin/master').  Here I can no longer follow your explanation.  I have
a feeling you actually want to avoid the merge commit as far as
possible.

In this case, you have to learn about rebase, as in 'git rebase
origin/master'.  This replays your commits (which should be only local)
on top of origin/master.  You will have to fix any conflict in your
commits, and you will end up with a linear history with your commits on
top of those already on origin/master.

Abort a rebase-gone-bad by 'git rebase --abort'.
