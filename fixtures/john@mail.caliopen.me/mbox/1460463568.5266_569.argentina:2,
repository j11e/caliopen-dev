Would expect that.

What about if going back and reflect from the starting point, if a well 
defined result of narrowing would be the best - without changing code in 
core at all?

When it narrows from midst of a sexp, its beginning is missing, okay. 
Where is the problem?
If this wasn't wanted, the narrowing was wrong. No need to fix this from 
Emacs side.

Sorry, should I not have understood what's at stake...
