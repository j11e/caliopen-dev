To be precise:

C-x C-w RET y RET

For avoiding the scary overwrite confirmation you use the prefix
argument:

C-u C-x C-w RET

Those of us who use ido-mode:

C-u C-x C-w C-j

IMO, those sequences are above of the threshold of what can be
considered convenient (definitely not recommended if you are prone to
suffering from RSI) and I expressed my preference for a new shorcut.
However, others were quick at dismissing that possibility.
