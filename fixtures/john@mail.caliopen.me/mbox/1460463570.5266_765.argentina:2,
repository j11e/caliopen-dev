Hello, Kaushal.

That massive commit happened because of git.  I attempted a 'git pull'
prior to making a (moderately small) commit.  There was a one-letter
typo in one of my existing files (which I think had been committed).
Because of that, git failed to merge in all the stuff which it had just
fetched from savannah, instead prompting me to do a manual merge, which
I then did.

This is a problem with SCM systems.  There is no "undo" for a lot of
operations.  If I had been aware of what was happening, I might have
been able to adjust my copy of the repository somehow so as to avoid
that large merge.

It would also be nice if such "pseudo merges" could be handled locally,
rather than being pushed back to the remote repository, causing
confusion.

See above.

No apologies needed.  git is a complicated, difficult to learn system.
