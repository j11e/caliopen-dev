Hi emacs-devel,

https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D18812 added a url-user-ag=
ent setting to Emacs, but it only partly addressed feature request. The o=
riginal suggestion was:

> The url.el functions for making HTTP requests set the User-Agent header=

> to "URL/Emacs" which is not very descriptive. It would be helpful to
> include the Emacs version, at least.

I'm bringing this up again, as I do think it would be useful to have a mo=
re informative User-Agent string. The new system is very useful for custo=
mization, but it does not address the original issue. The two main advant=
ages that I see for a more informative User-Agent string are these:

* Package archives could work around issues with old versions of package.=
el (for example, 24.3 is somewhat dependent to the order in which depende=
ncies are listed).
* Package authors could get per-version and possibly per-platform statist=
ics. Backwards compatibility is not always easy, so knowing which Emacs v=
ersions your users are on would be very useful, in particular to know whe=
n to drop support for an old version.

These use cases were raised in https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/3493=
, in particular. Interestingly, they don't necessarily suggest that we sh=
ould change url-user-agent; instead, wouldn't it be best for different pa=
rts of Emacs to use different user-agent strings? In particular, should e=
ww and package.el really use the same User-Agent string? We could instead=
 introduce separate a package-user-agent variable, and possibly an eww-us=
er-agent variable; this would be in line with what other programs do: it'=
s uncommon to advertise only the library used to access the web (in our c=
ase, =E2=80=98URL=E2=80=99) in a User-Agent string, instead of the actual=
 User-Agent.

Generally speaking, I would be in favor of always advertising the current=
 Emacs version, and the OS, instead of only advertising it for package.el=
: this would be in conformance with RFC 7231 (see below), and with what m=
any other browsers do (but fixing this issue by introducing a package-use=
r-agent string would work as well, and might alleviate some concerns that=
 were expressed in the original bug thread). Some expressed privacy conce=
rns about this, but other parts of Emacs already advertise this informati=
on fully (Stefan, for example, your emails are tagged with "Gnus/5.13 (Gn=
us v5.13) Emacs/25.1.50 (gnu/linux)"). Has there been complaints about Gn=
us doing that?

Are there reasons to prefer a very generic User-Agent string? Do these re=
asons also apply to a package.el-specific one?

Cheers,
Cl=C3=A9ment.
